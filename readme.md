# DL-MRg-NIRST network

1.Configure the environment according to Environment.txt
2.To test the trained model(Znet_3d.pkl), run the test_real.py file.
3.The dataset(test_01.mat) contains MRI data(128*128*144，144 MRI slices of size 128×128) and NIRST data(9*15*16，9 wavelengths, 15 detectors, and 16 sources).
4.For more details,please refer to 2025 paper <Deep learning enables fast and accurate quantification of MRI-guided near-infrared spectral tomography for breast cancer diagnosis>
